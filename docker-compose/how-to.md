1. You need to have all your monolith(s), gateway(s) and microservices in the same directory.
2. Create another directory, for example mkdir docker-compose.
3. Go into that directory: cd docker-compose.
4. Run the sub-generator: jhipster docker-compose.
5. The sub-generator will ask you which application you want to have in your architecture, and if you want to setup monitoring with ELK or Prometheus.
